# Real-Time-Gender-and-Age-Detection
In this project I showed that by learning representations through the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), a significant increase in performance can be obtained on these tasks. To this end, I used a simple convolutional net architecture that can be used even when the amount of learning data is limited. I evaluated my model on the recent UTKFace dataset for age, race and gender estimation and show how it dramatically outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.
